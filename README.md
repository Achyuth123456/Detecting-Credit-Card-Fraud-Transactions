# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud-Transactions
Credit card fraud is a pressing issue that affects millions of people worldwide, leading to significant financial losses for individuals and institutions alike. Inspired by the challenge of mitigating fraud through technology, I embarked on this project to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions.
What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained extensive knowledge in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I explored various machine learning algorithms, focusing on selecting the most effective one for fraud detection. Understanding the nuances of data imbalance was crucial, leading me to implement techniques like oversampling and undersampling to enhance model performance.

How I Built My Project
The project was developed using Python and several libraries, including:

Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Streamlit for building an interactive web application
Matplotlib for data visualization
I started by loading and analyzing a credit card transaction dataset, then proceeded to preprocess the data by scaling features and encoding categorical variables. Afterward, I trained a model and evaluated its performance based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

Challenges Faced
One of the major challenges I encountered was dealing with the highly imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions represented a small fraction of the total. This required innovative strategies to ensure that the model learned effectively from the available data. Additionally, integrating the model into a user-friendly web application was a learning curve that enhanced my software development skills.

Future Directions
Moving forward, I aim to improve the model's accuracy by experimenting with advanced algorithms and ensemble methods. I also plan to implement real-time transaction monitoring to enhance fraud detection capabilities.
